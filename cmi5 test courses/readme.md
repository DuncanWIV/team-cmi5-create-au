# cmi5 test courses directory purpose

Use this directory to upload your cmi5 courses or SCORM courses you would like team members to test using the cmi5 player prototype in their CTS instances.

**To upload your course:**
- select all the contents of your course folder
- compress the files as a .zip file
- create a new directory using a unique name*
- create a readme.md file in your new directory and describe the course and any issues you are encountering or features you would like members to test.
- upload the .zip file to your new directory

**To create a new directory with a new readme.md file:**
  - open the directory 'cmi5 test courses'
  - click the new file button
  - type 'my test course foo/readme.md'
  - now a new directory 'my test course foo' has been created and the readme.md file has been opened for you to start typing.
